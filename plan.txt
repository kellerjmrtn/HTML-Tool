1) Convert to TypeScript
2) Create tag Object for each Tag
3) Create node object for each Node... (has tag-start and tag-end objects attached?)

This allows looping through nodes and indenting all children

4) Add support for CSS indenting
5) Javascript indenting?
	- Will need many more nodes for this
